We want our model to be initially as simple as possible and then complicate it if necessary.
Let's consider $n$ agents with $\alpha$ coins each and let's define a time step as an interaction between two of them.
As interaction, we mean a match between two agents in which a cross-head game is played and the loser has to pay one coin to the winner.
In this case, we consider the probability to win equal to the probability to lose, regardless to the personal capital.
As boundary condition we assume that an agent will play only if he has at least 1 coin, effectively excluding those who have no money at all.
It's trivial that the $n = 0$ state of this system is an attractor and the dynamics will tend to take all players to 0 but one to $N = \alpha n$.
However, if we study the system at a sufficiently large time (but not so much to end up in the limit) we may find a well-defined trend.

In the fair game hypothesis every microstate has the same probability: our problem reduces to count the microstates corresponding to a unique macrostate.
For simplicity, let's consider 3 agents with one coin each: we can count the microstates of this system on the external surface of a 3D simplex, i.e. the surface with the shape of an equilateral triangle (effectively excluding surfaces living on planes), with sides of length 3, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:threeSimplex}.

    \label{fig:threeSimplex}
\end{figure}
For example, the point P = (3, 0, 0) is part of the surface and represents the state in which the i-agent has 3 coins and the others 0. \\
Likewise, the point Q = (2, 1, 0), which is also on the surface, represents the state in which the i-agent has 2 coins, the j-agent has 1 and the k-agent has 0, and so on.
It is now clear that, while the surface gives us the number of microstates corresponding to a macrostate (fixed amount of money), the volume between 0 and a fixed value $y$ such that $0 \leq y \leq N$ drawn in Fig. \ref{fig:simplexVolume} gives us the cumulative distribution of the microstates.
Defining our simplex as
\begin{equation*}
    \Delta^n(N)=\left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \text{ s.t. } \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i = N, x_i \geq 0\right\}
\end{equation*}
we can use the result of an article \cite{simplexSampling} in which the volume of a simplex between 0 and $y$ is found as
\begin{equation*}
    V_n\left(y, N\right) = \frac{\sqrt{n+1}}{n!}\left[N^n - \left(N - y\right)^n\right]
\end{equation*}

\end{figure}
We want to normalize it all as we are looking for a pdf, so we can divide $V_n\left(y, N\right)$ by $V_n\left(N, N\right)$ finding the cumulative distribution
\begin{equation*}
    F(y) = \frac{V_n\left(y, N\right)}{V_n\left(N, N\right)} = 1 - \left(1 - \frac{y}{N}\right)^n
\end{equation*}
We note that in our case $N=\alpha n$ so
\begin{equation*}
    F(y) =  1 - \left[\left(1 - \frac{y}{\alpha n}\right)^{\alpha n}\right]^\frac{1}{\alpha}
\end{equation*}
but $n$ is the dimension of the simplex, i.e. the number of agents of the system itself.
For a great amount of agents we can take the previous relation in the limit $n\to\infty$ obtaining
\begin{equation*}
    F(y) = 1 - e^{-\frac{y}{\alpha}}
\end{equation*}
Once that we have the cumulative distribution of the microstate it's trivial to find the pdf applying the definition
\begin{equation}
    f(y) = \frac{d}{dy}F(y) = \frac{1}{\alpha} e^{-\frac{y}{\alpha}}
    \label{eq:expo}
\end{equation}

\end{figure}
Now let's take $N = 10^4$ players and give $\alpha = 5$ coins each, then simulate a million of fair matches.
At the end of the simulation, let's plot the frequency of agents in respect of their capital and fit \cite{root} it with a function $y(x) = Ae^{Bx}$ as proved in Eq. (\ref{eq:expo}).
We  also expect $A \simeq -B \simeq \frac{1}{5}$.
As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:expo}, the fit seems to be according to the data.
In particular, it gives the parameters $A = 0.29$ and $B = -0.22$, compatible with the expected value $\frac{1}{5} = 0.20$.

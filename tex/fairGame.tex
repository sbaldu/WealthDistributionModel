We want our model to be initially as simple as possible and then complicate it if necessary.
Let's consider $n$ agents with $\alpha$ coins (arbitrary currency) each and let's define a time step as an interaction between two of them.
As interaction, we mean a match between two agents in which a cross-head game is played and the loser has to pay one coin to the winner.
In this case, we consider the probability to win equal to the probability to lose, regardless to the personal capital.
As boundary condition we assume that an agent will play regardless of his capital without being able to make debts. 
With this dynamics, every state has the same probability as the others but the zero one: the zero state is affected by the boundary condition and has a slightly different probability due to the fact that an agent could remain in that state after a match.
However, we can neglect this effect because the zero state is a null measure set.
If we study the system at a sufficiently large time we expect to find a well-defined trend.

Defining our simplex as
\begin{equation*}
    \Delta^{n-1}(N)=\left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \text{ s.t. } \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i = N, x_i \geq 0\right\}
\end{equation*}
we know \cite{simplexSampling} that its hypervolume, in the continuum limit, is given by
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{V}_{n-1}\left(N\right) = \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\left(n-1\right)!}N^{n-1}
\end{equation*}
For example, let's consider $n = 3$ agents with one coin each: the dynamics of this system is bounded on a $\left(n-1\right)$D = 2D simplex, i.e. the surface with the shape of an equilateral triangle, with sides of length $n\sqrt{2}=3\sqrt{2}$, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:threeSimplex}.

    \label{fig:threeSimplex}
\end{figure}
We have $N=3$ total coins, so the surface of this 2D simplex is given by $\mathcal{V}_{2}\left(3\right) = \frac{9\sqrt{3}}{2}$ which is exactly the area of the equilateral triangle.
Furthermore, the point $P = (3, 0, 0)$ is part of the surface and represents the state in which the \emph{i}-agent has 3 coins and the others 0.
Suppose now the \emph{i}-agents loses a game with the \emph{j}-agent: the system goes from the point P to the point $Q = (2, 1, 0)$, which is also on the surface, which represents the state in which the \emph{i}-agent has 2 coins, the \emph{j}-agent has 1 and the \emph{k}-agent has 0.
It is now clear that our problem is actually a random walk on a simple which surface gives us the number of all possible states.
Thus, the surface between 0 and a fixed value $y$ taken on the $e_k$ axis will give us all the possible states in which the \emph{k}-agent has a capital less or equal to $y$, i.e. something like to the cumulative distribution.
Let's pretend we want to find the probability that the \emph{k}-agent has a capital less or equal to $y=2$.

    \label{fig:threeSimplexCut}
\end{figure}
As we can see from Fig. \ref{fig:threeSimplexCut}, that probability is nothing but the surface $\mathcal{V}_{2}\left(3\right) - \mathcal{V}_{2}\left(1 = 3-2\right)$, i.e. the total surface of the simplex minus the surface of a same dimensional simplex with $N \to N-y$, normalized to the total surface $\mathcal{V}_{2}\left(3\right)$. 
In this very particular case, we obtain that the probability to have a capital $z \leq y$ is $\mathbb{P}(z \leq 2) = \frac{8}{9}$.
That is close to the real one, i.e. $\frac{9}{10}$: the error is due to the continuum limit assumption.
However, we expect it to tend to zero has the number of agent increases.

Let's now generalize the problem to $n$ dimensions, which corresponds to one dimension for each agent in the system.
In this case, the hypervolume between 0 and a fixed value $y$ such that $0 \leq y \leq N$, is found as
\begin{equation*}
    \Delta\mathcal{V}_{n-1}\left(y, N\right) \equiv \mathcal{V}_{n-1}\left(N\right) - \mathcal{V}_{n-1}\left(N-y\right) = \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\left(n-1\right)!}\left[N^{n-1} - \left(N - y\right)^{n-1}\right]

The probability that an agent has a capital $z \leq y$ is nothing but the ratio between $\Delta\mathcal{V}_{n-1}\left(y, N\right)$ and $\mathcal{V}_{n-1}\left(N\right)$, so
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbb{P}\left(z \leq y\right) \equiv F(y) = \frac{\Delta\mathcal{V}_{n-1}\left(y, N\right)}{\mathcal{V}_{n-1}\left(N\right)} = 1 - \left(1 - \frac{y}{N}\right)^{n-1}
\end{equation*}
where $F(y)$ is the cumulative distribution.
We note that in our case $N=\alpha n$ so
\begin{equation*}
    F(y) =  1 - \left[\left(1 - \frac{y}{\alpha n}\right)^{\alpha\left(n - 1\right)}\right]^\frac{1}{\alpha}
\end{equation*}
but $n$ is related to the dimension of the simplex, i.e. the number of agents of the system itself.
For a great amount of agents we can take the previous relation in the limit $n\to\infty$ obtaining
\begin{equation*}
    F(y) = 1 - e^{-\frac{y}{\alpha}}
\end{equation*}
Once that we have the cumulative distribution of the microstate it's trivial to find the pdf applying the definition
\begin{equation}
    f(y) = \frac{d}{dy}F(y) = \frac{1}{\alpha} e^{-\frac{y}{\alpha}}

    \label{fig:expo}
\end{figure}
Now let's take $N = 10^4$ players and give $\alpha = 5$ coins each, then simulate a million of fair matches..
At the end of the simulation, we plot the frequency of agents in respect of their capital and fit \cite{root} it with a general function 
\begin{equation}
    f(y) = Ce^{\gamma y}
    \label{eq:generalExpo}
\end{equation}
as proved in Eq. (\ref{eq:expo}).
We  also expect $C \simeq -\gamma \simeq \alpha^{-1}$.
As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:expo}, the fit seems to be according to the data.
In particular, it gives the parameters $C = 0.27 \pm 0.03$ and $\gamma = -0.21 \pm 0.01$, compatible with the expected value $\alpha^{-1} = 0.20$.

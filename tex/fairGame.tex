We want our model to be initially as simple as possible and then complicate it if necessary.
Let's consider $n$ agents with $\alpha$ coins (arbitrary currency) each and let's define a time step as an interaction between two of them.
As interaction, we mean a match between two agents in which a cross-head game is played and the loser has to pay one coin to the winner.
In this case, we consider the probability to win equal to the probability to lose, regardless to the personal capital.
As boundary condition we assume that an agent will play only if he has at least 1 coin, effectively excluding those who have no money at all.
It's trivial that the $n = 0$ state of this system is an attractor and the dynamics will tend to take all players to 0 but one to $N = \alpha n$.
However, if we study the system at a sufficiently large time (but not so much to end up in the limit) we may find a well-defined trend.

With this dynamics, every state has the same probability as the others but the zero one: the zero state is affected by the boundary condition and has a slightly different probability due to the fact that an agent could remain in that state after a match.
However, we can neglect this border effect because the zero state is a null measure set.
We can see our problem as a random walk on a simplex.
For simplicity, let's consider 3 agents with one coin each: we can count the microstates of this system on the external surface of a 3D simplex, i.e. the surface with the shape of an equilateral triangle (effectively excluding surfaces living on planes), with sides of length 3, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:threeSimplex}.

\end{figure}
For example, the point P = (3, 0, 0) is part of the surface and represents the state in which the i-agent has 3 coins and the others 0.
Suppose now the i-agents loses a game with the j-agent: the system goes from the point P to the point Q = (2, 1, 0), which is also on the surface, which represents the state in which the i-agent has 2 coins, the j-agent has 1 and the k-agent has 0.
\\It is now clear that, while the surface gives us the number of microstates corresponding to a macrostate (fixed amount of money), the volume between 0 and a fixed value $y$ such that $0 \leq y \leq N$ drawn in Fig. \ref{fig:simplexVolume} gives us the total number of states between 0 and $y$, i.e. something proportional to the cumulative distribution.
Suppose now we are in $n$ dimensions, which corresponds to one axis for each agent in the system.
To simplify the computations, we consider from now on the continuum limit in which the number of coins is a real value.
This assumption is actually strong but will be justified by the comparison with simulated data. 
Defining our simplex as
\begin{equation*}
    \Delta^n(N)=\left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \text{ s.t. } \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i = N, x_i \geq 0\right\}
\end{equation*}
we can use the result of an article \cite{simplexSampling} in which the area of a hypersurface between 0 and $y$ (actually a $n-1$ dimensional simplex) is found as
\begin{equation*}
    A_n\left(y, N\right) = \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\left(n-1\right)!}\left[N^{n-1} - \left(N - y\right)^{n-1}\right]
\end{equation*}
We want to know what's the probability that the k-agent has a number of coins less or equal to a fixed value $y$.
Looking at Fig. \ref{fig:simplexVolume} we can see that this probability is represented by the hypersurface with $e_k \leq y$.

We want to normalize it all as we are looking for a pdf, so we can divide $V_n\left(y, N\right)$ by $V_n\left(N, N\right)$, finding the cumulative distribution
\begin{equation*}
    F(y) = \frac{V_n\left(y, N\right)}{V_n\left(N, N\right)} = 1 - \left(1 - \frac{y}{N}\right)^{n-1}
\end{equation*}
We note that in our case $N=\alpha n$ so
\begin{equation*}
    F(y) =  1 - \left[\left(1 - \frac{y}{\alpha n}\right)^{\alpha n}\right]^\frac{1}{\alpha}
\end{equation*}
but $n$ is the dimension of the simplex, i.e. the number of agents of the system itself.
For a great amount of agents we can take the previous relation in the limit $n\to\infty$ obtaining
\begin{equation*}
    F(y) = 1 - e^{-\frac{y}{\alpha}}
\end{equation*}
Once that we have the cumulative distribution of the microstate it's trivial to find the pdf applying the definition
\begin{equation}
    f(y) = \frac{d}{dy}F(y) = \frac{1}{\alpha} e^{-\frac{y}{\alpha}}

    \label{fig:expo}
\end{figure}
Now let's take $N = 10^4$ players and give $\alpha = 5$ coins each, then simulate a million of fair matches..
At the end of the simulation, we plot the frequency of agents in respect of their capital and fit \cite{root} it with a general function 
\begin{equation}
    f(y) = Ce^{\gamma y}
    \label{eq:generalExpo}
\end{equation}
as proved in Eq. (\ref{eq:expo}).
We  also expect $C \simeq -\gamma \simeq \alpha^{-1}$.
As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:expo}, the fit seems to be according to the data.
In particular, it gives the parameters $C = 0.27 \pm 0.03$ and $\gamma = -0.21 \pm 0.01$, compatible with the expected value $\alpha^{-1} = 0.20$.

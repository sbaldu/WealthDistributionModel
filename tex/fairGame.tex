We want our model to be initially as simple as possible and then complicate it if necessary.
Let's consider $n$ agents with $\alpha$ coins (arbitrary currency) each and let's define a time step as an interaction between two of them.
As interaction, we mean a match between two agents in which a cross-head game is played and the loser has to pay one coin to the winner.
In this case, we consider the probability to win equal to the probability to lose, regardless to the personal capital.
As boundary condition we assume that an agent will play regardless of his capital without being able to make debts. 
With this dynamics, every state has the same probability as the others but the zero one: the zero state is affected by the boundary condition and has a slightly different probability due to the fact that an agent could remain in that state after a match.
However, we can neglect this effect because the zero state is a null measure set.
If we study the system at a sufficiently large time we expect to find a well-defined trend.

For simplicity, let's consider $n = 3$ agents with one coin each: the dynamics of this system  is bounded on a $\left(n-1\right)$D = 2D simplex, i.e. the surface with the shape of an equilateral triangle, with sides of length $n\sqrt{2}=3\sqrt{2}$, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:threeSimplex}.

    \caption{\emph{A 2D simplex represented in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Every dot on that surface represents a possible state of the system.}}
    \label{fig:threeSimplex}
\end{figure}
For example, the point $P = (3, 0, 0)$ is part of the surface and represents the state in which the \emph{i}-agent has 3 coins and the others 0.
Suppose now the \emph{i}-agents loses a game with the \emph{j}-agent: the system goes from the point P to the point $Q = (2, 1, 0)$, which is also on the surface, which represents the state in which the \emph{i}-agent has 2 coins, the \emph{j}-agent has 1 and the \emph{k}-agent has 0.
\\It is now clear that the surface gives us the number of all possible states, so our problem is actually a random walk on a simplex.
Thus, the surface between 0 and a fixed value $y$ taken on the $e_k$ axis will give us all the possible states in which the \emph{k}-agent has a capital less or equal to $y$, i.e. something like to the cumulative distribution.

Let's now generalize the problem to $n$ dimensions, which corresponds to one dimension for each agent in the system.
We can define our simplex as
\begin{equation*}
    \Delta^{n-1}(N)=\left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \text{ s.t. } \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i = N, x_i \geq 0\right\}
\end{equation*}
To simplify the computations, due to the fact that we have a very high number of agents, we consider from now on the continuum limit, approximating the volume of our simplex (in which every state is a tuple of integers) with the result of an article \cite{simplexSampling} in which the hypervolume we're interested in is found as
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{V}_{n-1}\left(y, N\right) = \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\left(n-1\right)!}\left[N^{n-1} - \left(N - y\right)^{n-1}\right]
\end{equation*}
We want to know what's the probability that an agent, let's say the \emph{k}-agent, has a number of coins less or equal to a fixed value $y$.
This hypervolume is simplified by a 3D plot in Fig. \ref{fig:simplexHypervolume}.

The probability to have a capital $z \leq y$ is nothing but the ratio between $\mathcal{V}_{n-1}\left(y, N\right)$ by $\mathcal{V}_{n-1}\left(N, N\right)$, so
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbb{P}\left(z \leq y\right) \equiv F(y) = \frac{\mathcal{V}_{n-1}\left(y, N\right)}{\mathcal{V}_{n-1}\left(N, N\right)} = 1 - \left(1 - \frac{y}{N}\right)^{n-1}
\end{equation*}
where $F(y)$ is the cumulative distribution.
We note that in our case $N=\alpha n$ so
\begin{equation*}
    F(y) =  1 - \left[\left(1 - \frac{y}{\alpha n}\right)^{\alpha\left(n - 1\right)}\right]^\frac{1}{\alpha}
\end{equation*}
but $n$ is the dimension of the simplex, i.e. the number of agents of the system itself.
For a great amount of agents we can take the previous relation in the limit $n\to\infty$ obtaining
\begin{equation*}
    F(y) = 1 - e^{-\frac{y}{\alpha}}
\end{equation*}
Once that we have the cumulative distribution of the microstate it's trivial to find the pdf applying the definition
\begin{equation}
    f(y) = \frac{d}{dy}F(y) = \frac{1}{\alpha} e^{-\frac{y}{\alpha}}

    \label{fig:expo}
\end{figure}
Now let's take $N = 10^4$ players and give $\alpha = 5$ coins each, then simulate a million of fair matches..
At the end of the simulation, we plot the frequency of agents in respect of their capital and fit \cite{root} it with a general function 
\begin{equation}
    f(y) = Ce^{\gamma y}
    \label{eq:generalExpo}
\end{equation}
as proved in Eq. (\ref{eq:expo}).
We  also expect $C \simeq -\gamma \simeq \alpha^{-1}$.
As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:expo}, the fit seems to be according to the data.
In particular, it gives the parameters $C = 0.27 \pm 0.03$ and $\gamma = -0.21 \pm 0.01$, compatible with the expected value $\alpha^{-1} = 0.20$.

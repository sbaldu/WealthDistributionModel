Finally, we want to analyze some real data of distribution of income and compare the real distribution with the ones obtained in the previous models. \\
From now on we'll consider the distribution of annual income in the USA, where the data was extracted from the 1994 census. The global distribution of income is the following:
\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \scalebox{.7}{\input{./img/global_real_distribution.pgf}}
    \caption{\emph{}}
    \label{fig:gloabl_realData}
\end{figure}
We see that the trend is what we'd expect it to be: there is a peak for small values of income and then the tren is decreasing as the values get larger. The positive trend near the origin can be attributed to a redistribution system implemented by the state, in order to prevent too many people from becoming poor. \\
We then see that for intermediate incomes the trendis an exponential decrease
\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \scalebox{.7}{\input{./img/real_head.pgf}}
    \caption{\emph{}}
    \label{fig:real_head}
\end{figure}
 and at the tail of the distribution we have a power law decrease.
\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \scalebox{.7}{\input{./img/real_tail.pgf}}
    \caption{\emph{}}
    \label{fig:real_tail}
\end{figure}
This kind of trend, in particular the exponential behaviour for small incomes and the power law decrease for large incomes is compatible with the model defined in paragraph \ref{savings}, which introduces the concept of savings.

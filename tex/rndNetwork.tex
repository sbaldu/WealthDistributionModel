Observing the real distributions of wealth one can notice that poorness and richness are attractive properties, which means that poors (riches) tend to impoverish (enrich) their neighbors.
The result of this is that looking at the network one can observe the formation of clusters of both rich and poor individuals. \\
However, to observe this we must move from a fully connected network, where everybody can interact with everybody, to a partially connected network, where each individual is linked to a few others.
So, we now take a random network in which every agent has a uniformly distributed number of links, with mean $12$, keeping previous parameters and dynamics preserved.
At this point, if we let the system evolve, we expect to see again an exponential distribution of wealth: in Fig. \ref{fig:fixedExpo} we obtain a fit with $C = 0.24$ and $\gamma = -0.22 \pm 0.02$ as predicted by Eq. (\ref{eq:expo}).

\end{figure}
We want now to confirm our hypothesis, i.e. that poors form clusters.
To do this, we define the null hypothesis as the probability that an individual is poor doesn't depend on the neighbors.
If the null hypothesis is true, then the conditional probability of being poor given that a neighbor is also poor should be identical to the probability of being poor in general:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{P}(poor \ | \ neighbour=poor) = \mathbb{P}(poor)
	\label{eq:nullHypothesis}
\end{equation}
We then want to calculate these two probabilities and show that they are indeed different, thus showing that the null hypothesis is false. \\
During the evolution, when an agent's wealth goes under a certain threshold, which we've set to $15 \%$ of the initial capital, we include him in the list containing all the poors.
At the end of the evolution we can calculate the probability of becoming poor simply using the frequentist definition of probability:
$$
	\mathbb{P}(poor) = \frac{\# \ poor \ individuals}{\# \ size \ of \ the \ population}
$$
Then, to calculate the conditional probability in Eq. (\ref{eq:nullHypothesis}) we count the poors, under the condition that they have a poor neighbor. \\
In this way we find a probability $\mathbb{P}(poor) = 11.72 \%$ and a conditional probability $\mathbb{P}(poor \ | \ neighbor=poor) = 31.57 \%$.
The two probabilities are significantly different, and this suggests that the null hypothesis is false and gives us reason to believe that poorness is indeed an attractive trait.

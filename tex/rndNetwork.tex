One of the main question for this type of model may be: how long does it take for a poor player to become rich (and vice versa)?
However, to answer this question the previous model is not ideal.
The full randomness of interactions does not represent a reality in which every agent has a fixed amount of individual to interact with (like friends, the favorite bar/supermarket etc.).
To take this limit into account we must reduce the size of our network (that was $N^2$), taking a smaller net in which every agent can interact with few of the others.
In this type of situation we expect the formation of \emph{clusters}, both of rich and poor.
Ideally, if a player is poor will tend to impoverish his neighbors and in the same way a rich player will tend to enrich his neighbors.

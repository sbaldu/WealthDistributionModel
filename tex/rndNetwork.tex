Observing the real distributions of wealth one can notice that poorness and richness are attractive properties, which means that poor (riches) tend to impoverish (enrich) their neighbors.
The result of this is that looking at the network one can observe the formation of clusters of both rich and poor individuals. \\
However, to observe this we must move from a fully connected network, where everybody can interact with everybody, to a partially connected network, where each individual is linked to a few others.
So, we now take a random network in which every agent has a uniformly distributed number of links, with mean $12$, keeping previous parameters and dynamics preserved.
At this point, if we let the system evolve, we expect to see again an exponential distribution of wealth: in Fig. \ref{fig:fixedExpo} we obtain a fit with $C = 0.24 \pm 0.02$ and $\gamma = -0.22 \pm 0.02$ as predicted by Eq. (\ref{eq:expo}).

We want now to confirm our hypothesis, i.e. that poor form clusters.
This would mean that the probability that an agent is poor would be larger if one or more of its neighbors (individuals linked to it in the network) were also poor.
Another way to look at this is considering that the probability that two agents randomly chosen among the network are linked increases if we know that both of them are poor. \\
If we consider the probability that both the agents are poor, and they are also linked, we have:
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbb{P}(x \ poor \cap y \ poor \cap linked)
\end{equation*}
This can be written in terms of the conditional probability:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        \mathbb{P}(x \ poor \cap y \ poor \cap linked) =& \mathbb{P}(linked \ \vert \ x \ poor \cap y \ poor) \mathbb{P}(x \ poor \cap y \ poor)\\
	                                                   =& \mathbb{P}(linked \ \vert \ x \ poor \cap y \ poor) \mathbb{P}(x \ poor)\mathbb{P}(y \ poor)
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
Where we considered the fact that the two random agents $x$ and $y$ are poor to be independent events. \\
At this point, to test our hypothesis, we want to compare the conditional probability $\mathbb{P}(linked \vert x poor \cap y poor)$ with the generic probability that two agents in a random couple are linked, $\mathbb{P}(linked)$.
Our null hypothesis is that the probability of having a linked couple of agents doesn't change if we know that they are both poor. \\
If this is true, we would expect $\mathbb{P}(linked \vert x poor \cap y poor) = \mathbb{P}(linked)$, and then the poorness of two individuals would be completely unrelated to the fact that they are linked. \\
To compute the conditional probability we take a list of all the poor individuals and compute all the possible combinations of them.
Then, we scan through them and count in how many of these couples the two agents are linked. \\
To calculate the probability $\mathbb{P}(linked)$ we take all the agents in the network and compute all the possible combinations of them, and then we count in how many of them the couple is linked. \\
Through the simulation we find for these two probabilities the values:
\begin{equation*}
	\mathbb{P}(linked \ \vert \ x \ poor \cap y \ poor) = 0.72\%
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
	\mathbb{P}(linked) = 0.98\%
\end{equation*}
The two probabilities show an enough significant difference to suggest that the null hypothesis is false, thus the poorness is indeed an attractive trait.

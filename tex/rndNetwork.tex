Observing the real distributions of wealth shows that poorness in an attractive property, which means that poors tend to make their neighbors poorer, or in other words, they prevent them from getting richer. The result of this is that looking at the network one can observe the formation of clusters of poor individuals. \\
To observe this we must move from a fully connected network, where everybody can interact with everybody, to a fixed partially connected network, where each individual is linked to a small number of individuals. So, we create the network and randomly distribute the links between all the individuals, and keep those links fixed for the entire evolution of the system. \\
At this point, if we let the system evolve using the uniform evolution seen before, we expect to see again an exponential distribution of wealth. And this is in fact what we see:

\end{figure}
At this point, we want to confirm our hypothesis, that poors form clusters. \\
To do this, we define the null hypothesis, that is that the probability that an individual is poor doesn't depend on the neighbors. If the null hypothesis was true, that the conditional probability of being poor, knowing that a neighbour is also poor, should be identical to the probability of being poor in general:
$$
	p(poor \ | \ neighbour=poor) = p(poor)
	\label{eq:condition_for_null}
$$
We then want to calculate this two probabilities and show that they are indeed different, thus showing that the null hypothesis is false. \\
During the evolution, when an individual's wealth goes under a certain threshold, which we've set to $15 \%$ of the initial capital, we include the individual in the list containing all the poors. At the end of the evolution, then, we can calculate the probability of becoming poor simply using the frequentistic definition of probability:
$$
	p(poor) = \frac{\# \ poor \ individuals}{\# \ size \ of \ the \ population}
$$
Then, to calculate the conditional probability in equation \ref{eq:condition_for_null} we count the poors, under the condition that they have a poor neighbour. \\
In this way we find a probability $p(poor) = 11.56 \%$ and a conditional probability $p(poor \ | \ neighbour=poor) = 32.87 \%$. The two probabilities are significantly different, and this suggests that the null hypothesis is false and gives us reason to believe that poorness is indeed an attractive trait.

The basic model, which implements a fully connected network, where any agent can interact with any other and both have the same winning chance, produces a wealth distribution which follows an exponential decay, given by Eq. (\ref{eq:generalExpo}).
By fitting the simulated data with this model we have found for the constant an estimate $C = 0.27 \pm 0.03$, and for the exponent $\gamma = -0.21 \pm 0.01$.
Given that the expected value for both was $\alpha^{-1} = 0.20$, the model is well representing the theory.

However, in social models we rarely see fully connected networks but partially connected ones: that means that each individual can only interact with few others.
The number of links that an individual makes is so an important parameter, because it determines how much and how quickly that individual can change its state. \\
For this reason we've implemented a fixed network, where each agent has a uniformly distributed number of links with mean $12$.
In this case we expect again to see an exponential wealth distribution, because we haven't implemented any kind of preferential attachment. \\
This is actually what we see, and by fitting the data with the same Eq. (\ref{eq:generalExpo}) we find the estimates for the parameters $C = 0.24 \pm 0.02$ and $\gamma = -0.22 \pm 0.02$, slightly better than the previous ones.

Another thing that we wanted to prove for this model was that poorness is an attractive property, so when an individual becomes poor it tends to impoverish its neighbors too (the individuals to whom it's linked).
This statement is equivalent to saying that the probability of being poor $\mathbb{P}(poor)$ is not equal to the conditional probability of being poor, given that a neighbor is also poor, $\mathbb{P}(poor \ | \ neighbour=poor)$. \\
Computing the two probabilities, we've found that $\mathbb{P}(poor) = 11.72 \%$ and \\ $\mathbb{P}(poor \ | \ neighbour=poor) = 31.57 \%$, so due to the significant difference we can safely accept our hypothesis.

We then introduced a preferential attachment behavior, giving to the richer agents a higher probability of winning a single encounter with a poorer one.
We expected this type of evolution to slow down the decrease of the distribution, hence increasing the number of very rich individuals.
In particular, we were expecting the distribution to become a power law, as described in Eq. (\ref{eq:paretoPDF}).
By fitting the data with this model we have found the estimates for the parameter $\al = -1.83 \pm 0.08$.
We expected the exponent's value to be compatible with Zipf's law, since it is very typical for preferential attachment phenomena.
In fact, Zipf's law predicts a ranking distribution described in Eq. (\ref{eq:zipf}), which is fully compatible with the pdf that we've found with the exponent $b = -1.22 \pm 0.11 \simeq -1$.

Finally, we've implemented a model that allows the agents save a portion of their capital.
We expect this to be the model that best describes the real distribution of wealth, due to the fact that it takes into account both preferential attachment and saving parameter.
By giving to $99 \%$ of the agents a null saving propensity $\la$ and to the remaining $1 \%$ values of $\la$ which are uniformly distributed between $0$ and $1$, we find a distribution which is exponential for small capitals and turns into a power law towards the highest values. \\
If we compare this trend with some real data, we can see that the two are actually compatible.

For example, let's consider the distribution of annual wealth in the USA, where data were extracted from the 1994 census and drawn in Fig. \ref{fig:gloabl_realData}.

\end{figure}
We see that the trend is what we'd expect it to be: there is a peak for small values of wealth and then the trend is decreasing as the values get larger.
The positive trend near the origin can be attributed to a redistribution system implemented by the state, e.g. the welfare, in order to prevent too many people from becoming poor. \\
We then see in Fig. \ref{fig:real_head} that for intermediate wealth the trend is an exponential.
For higher values of wealth there is a hint of a power law behavior visible in Fig. \ref{fig:real_tail}, but it's not enough to say that the distribution follows a power law, because the values span over less than one order of magnitude.

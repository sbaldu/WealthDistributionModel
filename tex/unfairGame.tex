Looking at real data, it can be seen that in real life money is distributed following a power law, instead of an exponential.
The power law goes to zero slower than the exponential, so the real-life distribution for money is more fair than what we have hypothesized in our model. \\
So, in order to have the model reproduce the real-life distribution we have to introduce some unfairness in the model.
The best way to do so is to introduce a preferential attachment, which means that individuals who have more money have a higher probability of earning more money.
So in this case the richer individuals have an attractive property, which allows them to earn more money as they get richer. \\
To implement this preferential attachment we can change the probabilities of winning and losing in a way that favors the individuals with more money.
If $\epsilon$ is the probability that the richer individual wins then $\bar{\epsilon} = 1 - \epsilon$ is the probability that it's the poorer who wins, we can define them as follows:
\begin{equation}
	\varepsilon = \frac{r + 1}{r + p + 2} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \bar{\varepsilon} = \frac{p + 1}{r + p + 2}
	\label{eq:prefAttach}
\end{equation}
where $r$ is the capital of the richer one and $p$ the capital of the poorer.
We notice that using these probabilities even an individual without any money has a winning chance.
Using the same values of $N$ and $\alpha$ as before, we now let the system evolve $4 \times 10^5$ times using the probabilities defined in the relation (\ref{eq:prefAttach}).

    \label{fig:prefAttach}
\end{figure}
In this case, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:prefAttach}, the distribution is not exponential anymore but a power law.
We expected this: considering a dependence on the actual capital to the probability means that we actually added \emph{memory} to the dynamics.
In fact, in a system with memory each time step is not independent of the previous ones.
In this case, data are fitted with a law of the type $f(x) = Ax^B$ where we expect $A > 0$ and $B < 0$.
The fit gives us the values $A = 1.65$ and $B = -1.82$, compatible with the hypothesis.

Moreover, we expect this distribution to obey the Zipf's law, which is typical of preferential attachment phenomena.
Zipf's law states that the income $n$ of people with rank $r$ has a power behavior:
\begin{equation}
    n(r) \sim r^b \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ b \simeq -1
    \label{eq:zipf}
\end{equation}
We can now reverse the previous relationship \cite{zipf} obtaining that the number $r$ of people whose income is $n$ or higher is given by
\begin{equation}
    r(n) \sim n^{\frac{1}{b}}
    \label{eq:pareto}
\end{equation}
We notice that Eq. (\ref{eq:pareto}) is a cumulative distribution.
By deriving and normalizing it we can obtain the distribution that tells us the frequency of people whose income is exactly $n$
\begin{equation}
    f(n) \sim n^{\frac{1}{b} - 1}
    \label{eq:paretoPDF}
\end{equation}

If we compare the results of Eq. (\ref{eq:paretoPDF}) with those of the fit Eq. (\ref{eq:prefAttach}) we notice that the Zipf's behavior is well reproduced with $b = -1.22 \simeq -1$.

Looking at real data (CITATION NEEDED), it can be seen that in real life money is distributed following a power law, instead of an exponential.
The power law goes to zero slower than the exponential, so the real-life distribution for money is more fair than what we have hypothesized in our model. \\
So, in order to have the model reproduce the real-life distribution we have to introduce some unfairness in the model.
The best way to do so is to introduce a preferential attachment, which means that individuals who have more money have a higher probability of earning more money.
So in this case the richer individuals have an attractive property, which allows them to earn more money as they get richer. \\
To implement this preferential attachment we can change the probabilities of winning and losing in a way that favors the individuals with more money.
If $\epsilon$ is the probability that the richer individual wins then $\bar{\epsilon} = 1 - \epsilon$ is the probability that it's the poorer who wins, we can define them as follows:
\begin{equation}
	\varepsilon = \frac{r + 1}{r + p + 2} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \bar{\varepsilon} = \frac{p + 1}{r + p + 2}
	\label{eq:prefAttach}
\end{equation}
where $r$ is the capital of the richer one, $p$ the capital of the poorer.
We notice that using these probabilities even an individual without any money has a winning chance.
Using the same values of $N$ and $\alpha$ as before, we now let the system evolve $4 \times 10^5$ times using the probabilities defined in the relation (\ref*{eq:prefAttach}).

\end{figure}
In this case, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:prefAttach}, the distribution is not exponential anymore but a power law.
We expected this: considering a dependence on the actual capital to the probability means that we actually added \emph{memory} to the dynamics.
In fact, in a system with memory each time step is not independent of the previous ones.
In this case, data are fitted with a law of the type $f(x) = A\frac{1}{x^B}$ where we expect $A > 0$ and $B \sim -2$.
The fit gives us the values $A = 1.65$ and $B = -1.82 \sim -2$, compatible with the hypothesis.
We expected $B \sim -2$ because we expect an interaction of this kind to follow the Zipf's law, typical of preferential attachments phenomena.
However, Zipf's law represents a ranking distribution, i.e. a cumulative distribution, while we found a pdf.
Nevertheless, we can easily demonstrate that both laws are mutually compatible using the definition of cumulative distribution:
\begin{equation*}
	F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f(x') dx' \propto \int_{-\infty}^x \frac{1}{{x'}^2} dx' = \frac{1}{x}
\end{equation*}
which is the Zipf's law.

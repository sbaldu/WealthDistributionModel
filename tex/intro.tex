One of the main challenge of the study of complex systems is to work out models that simplify real life problems giving likely solutions.
Purpose of this project is to simulate money exchanges between people, using a very simplified model that only takes into account random interactions.
First, the study will address a \emph{fair game}, i.e. a game in which every agent has the same probability to win then loose as compared to the other one.
This analysis will provide an exponential trend that will also will be proved theoretically but very unlikely.
Second, we'll try to improve the model introducing a so-called \emph{preferential attachment}, that means that the probability to win will be proportional to the amount of money posseded.
This will provide a power trend that most countries seems to follow.

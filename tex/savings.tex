To improve further our mode, we can adopt a slightly different approach based on kinetic theory \cite{econophysics}. \\
Let's consider an ideal gas, containing $N$ particles, each of which has $x_j$ energy, representing their capital.
Unlike the previous models, now the wealth is represented by a continuous variable (at least classically).
The state of the system is characterized by the vector containing the energies of all the particles, $\{x_j\}_{1,\ldots,N}$, with the constraint that the total energy is preserved
\begin{equation}
	\sum_j x_j = X_0
\end{equation}
The particles in the gas, during their motion, can collide each other and in these collisions there is and exchange of kinetic energy.
The most basic equations for the exchange of energy are equivalent to the ones seen in the previous models:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		x'_i = x_i - \Delta x \\
		x'_j = x_j + \Delta x 
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
where we require both the energies $x_i$ and $x_j$ to be positive. \\
Here the quantity of energy exchanged is constant.
Alternatively, we can define a factor which is generated randomly at each iteration and represents a random fluctuation in the fraction of energy exchanged in the collision.
So the equations become:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		x'_i = \varepsilon(x_i + x_j)	 \\
		x'_j = \bar{\varepsilon}(x_i + x_j)
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{\epsilon} = 1 - \epsilon$. \\

In order to reproduce the real wealth distributions we can complicate the model further by introducing a saving propensity.
In this scope, we introduce a parameter $\la$ which takes real values between $0$ and $1$ and represents the fraction of energy conserved (and not exchanged) in the collisions. \\
Introducing this new component, the equations become:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		x'_i = \la_ix_i + \varepsilon((1-\la_i)x_i + (1-\la_j)x_j) 	\\
		x'_j = \la_jx_j + \bar{\varepsilon}((1-\la_i)x_i + (1-\la_j)x_j) 	\\
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
Let's now consider $N = 10^5$ agents with $\alpha = 5$ money each.
By assigning a value $\la = 0$ to the $99 \%$ of the agents, and values of $\la$ uniformly distributed between $0$ and $1$ to the remaining $1\%$, the obtained distribution drawn in Fig. \ref{fig:savings} results in the combination of two different trends: for small capitals, the behavior is exponential, whereas at large values of $x$ it follows a power law distribution, which is produced by the individuals with values of $\la$ near $1$.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \scalebox{.7}{\input{./img/savings.pgf}}
    \caption{\emph{Wealth distribution for the saving model with the parameters $\varepsilon$ and $\bar{\varepsilon}$ randomly generated. By fitting the data with Eq. (\ref{eq:paretoPDF}) we obtain an estimate for the exponent of $a = -4.4 \pm 0.1$.}}
    \label{fig:savings}
\end{figure}
If we take the parameters $\varepsilon$ and $\bar{\varepsilon}$ as we did in Eq. (\ref{eq:prefAttach}) instead of generating them randomly, we obtain the trend drawn in Fig. \ref{fig:savingsPref}, with a ``smooth peak'' just before the exponential trend.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \scalebox{.7}{\input{./img/savingPreferential.pgf}}
    \caption{\emph{Wealth distribution for the saving model with the parameters $\varepsilon$ and $\bar{\varepsilon}$ taken as described in the relation (\ref{eq:prefAttach}). By fitting the data with Eq. (\ref{eq:paretoPDF}) we obtain an estimate for the exponent of $a = -4.2 \pm 0.1$.}}
    \label{fig:savingsPref}
\end{figure}
We can compare this plot with the distribution of real data.
For example, in Fig. \ref{fig:savingsLog} is reported the distribution of wealth in the USA from the 1994 census in log-log scale (this dataset will be discussed more in detail in the next section).
\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{\emph{Wealth distribution in the USA from 1994 census, in log-log scale.}}
    \label{fig:savingsLog}
\end{figure}
In particular, we notice how this model well reproduce the real behavior for the last two orders of magnitude.
